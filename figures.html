        <p class="heading text-primary">Figures</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Deng-Xiaoping.html">Deng Xiaoping</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">Deng is credited to be the "architect" of China's economic reform. Deng created a series of Special Economic Zones, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Xiamen, for foreign investment that were relatively free of the bureaucratic regulations and interventions that hampered economic growth. These regions became engines of growth for the national economy.
        </p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Zhao-Ziyang.html">Zhao Ziyang</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">Zhao was one of the founders of China's liberal economic policies. Together with another Chinese reformer, Deng Xiaoping, and the long-time Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, Zhao steered the early stages of the country's agricultural and industrial reforms. Unfortunately, the whole thing came to an inglorious end after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
        </p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Hu-Yaobang.html">Hu Yaobang</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">Throughout the 1980s, Hu pursued a series of economic and political reforms under the direction of Deng. Hu's political and economic reforms made him the enemy of several powerful Party elders, who opposed free market reforms and Hu's reforms of China's government.
        </p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Chen-Yun.html">Chen Yun</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">During the 1980s, Chen was very much involved in policy discussions. In the beginning and as one of the major architects for the reform and opening up, he supported Deng and the liberal market reforms that had been so successful in agriculture to urban areas and the industrial sector.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Li-Xiannian.html">Li Xiannian</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">One of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party, he was considered the most leftist among them, both politically and economically. Li played a key role in blocking privatizations and maintaining state control in many sectors of the economy.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Li-Peng.html">Li Peng</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">Li advocated a cautious approach to economic liberalization, and his chief concern was the maintenance of economic and political stability under the direction of the central government. When massive student protests calling for economic reforms and more democratic government broke out at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in April 1989, Li was foremost among those advocating the demonstrators' suppression by force if necessary.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Jiang-Zemin.html">Jiang Zemin</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">In 1993, Jiang coined the new "socialist market economy" to move China's centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated capitalist market economy. It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng's "Socialism with Chinese characteristics".</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Zhu-Rongji.html">Zhu Rongji</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">He emerged as a leader of economic reform in 1993 after putting himself in charge of the People's Bank of China and creating a program that reduced the countryâ€™s inflation. Noted for his pragmatism and no-nonsense approach, Zhu was named premier on March 17, 1998.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Hu-Jintao.html">Hu Jintao</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">During his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with his colleague Premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Wen-Jiabao.html">Wen Jiabao</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">Wen was dubbed "the people's premier" by both domestic and foreign media. Instead of concentrating on GDP growth in large cities and rich coastal areas, Wen advocated for advancing policies considered more favourable towards farmers and migrant workers.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Xi-Jinping.html">Xi Jinping</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed National Security Commission, as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.</p>
        <div class="component figure"><a href="figures-pages/Li-Keqiang.html">Li Keqiang</a></div><br>
        <p class="text">Given his Youth League experience, Li has generally been considered a political ally of former leader Hu Jintao. Li assumed the post of Premier in 2013, and has facilitated the Chinese government's shifting of priorities from export-led growth to a greater focus on internal consumption. Li has also been a major force behind the implementation of the "comprehensively deepening reforms" announced in the fall of 2013.</p>
