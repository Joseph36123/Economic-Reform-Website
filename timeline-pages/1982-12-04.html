The following bullet points summarize the contribution of the 1982 Constitution.
        </p>
        <li class="text">It removed language with Culture Revolution characteristics, such as "continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat".
        </li>
        <li class="text">The clause "The country is led by the Communist Party of China" is abolished, and the word "Communist Party of China" does not appear directly in the text of the Constitution.
        </li>
        <li class="text">It stipulates that "no organization or individual shall have privileges beyond the constitution and laws", including the Communist Party of China.
