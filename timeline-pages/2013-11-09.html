        <p class="text">In the Third Plenary Session of the eighteenth central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping made a report on behalf of the Politburo titled '"The Decision on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms". This report outlined the Belt and Road Initiative. The Belt and Road Initiative is a global infrastructure development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013 to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organizations. It is considered a centerpiece of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping's foreign policy. The BRI forms a central component of Xi's "Major Country Diplomacy" strategy, which calls for China to assume a greater leadership role for global affairs in accordance with its rising power and status. As of March 2022, 146 countries were listed as having signed up to the BRI.
