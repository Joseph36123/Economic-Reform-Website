        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="text">The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is a stock exchange based in the city of Shanghai, China. It is one of the three stock exchanges operating independently in mainland China. The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the world's 3rd largest stock market by market capitalization at US$7.62 trillion as of July 2021. It is also Asia's biggest stock exchange. Unlike the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is still not entirely open to foreign investors and often affected by the decisions of the central government, due to capital account controls exercised by the Chinese mainland authorities.
