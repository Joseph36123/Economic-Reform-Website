        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="text">"Resolution on Several Historical Issues of the Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" was held on June 27, 1981 at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The resolution provides an official summary of the main historical events since the founding of the People's Republic of China (especially the Cultural Revolution), as part of the Communist Party's campaign to set things right. The resolution served as an official evaluation of the merits and demerits of some important historical figures (including Mao Zedong). It plays a series of important roles in drawing conclusions on controversial historical issues within the party, comprehensively summarizing the party's historical experience, unifying the thinking of the whole party, and providing guidance for future development.
