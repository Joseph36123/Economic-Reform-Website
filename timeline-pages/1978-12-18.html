        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="text">The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from December 18 to December 22, 1978. From November 10 to December 15, 1978, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a 36-day Central Work Conference. The meeting is regarded as the beginning of the Deng Xiaoping era and reform and opening up. The conference marked the beginning of the "Reform and Opening Up" policy, and is widely seen as the moment when Deng Xiaoping became paramount leader of China replacing Chairman Hua Guofeng, who remained nominal Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party until 1981. The meeting was a decisive turning point in post-1949 Chinese history, marking the beginning of the wholesale repudiation of Chairman Mao's "Cultural Revolution" policies, and set China on the course for nationwide economic reforms.
