        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="text">In 2002, when the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, leaders such as Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, who supported the reform, began to step down from their leadership positions. Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, who were more conservative, began to reverse the original reform measures. Observers found that the administration's policies incorporated more "egalitarian" and "populist" elements. The Hu-Wen government increased subsidies and controls over the healthcare sector and halted privatization. Because of this, China's economy has been evaluated by the liberal media as showing a trend of the state taking over the people.
