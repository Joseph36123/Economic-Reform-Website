        <p class="text">Zhu Rongji is a retired Chinese politician who served as Premier of the People's Republic of China from 1998 to 2003 along with China's paramount leader Jiang Zemin. In his capacity as First Vice-Premier and Premier, Zhu was regarded as the leading figure behind China's economic policy in the 1990s and early 2000s. He also served as Mayor of Shanghai from 1988 to 1991 and Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai from 1989 to 1991.He served alongside Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and had a testy relationship with Jiang. Zhu had a reputation as a tough but pragmatic administrator. During his office, China's economy saw double digit growth. Zhu was also much more popular than his predecessor Li Peng among the Chinese public. However, Zhu's opponents stipulate that his tough and pragmatic stance on policy was unrealistic and unnecessary, and many of his promises were left unfulfilled. Zhu retired in 2003 and has not been a public figure since.
