        <p class="text">Chen Yun was one of the most influential leaders of the People's Republic of China during the 1980s and 1990s and one of the major architects and important policy makers for the Reform and opening up, alongside Deng Xiaoping. He was one of the major political leaders of China both during and after the Chinese Civil War, along with Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De and Ren Bishi, and was later recognized as one of the Eight Elders of the Chinese Communist Party. In the 1980s and 1990s, Chen Yun was regarded as the second-most powerful person in China, after Deng Xiaoping.
